  Experiments on implementing SLAM using implicit representations and Nerf like volume rednering with a few added changes to the architecture.

  ### To-DO
- [x] Add visualizaton of results obtained.
- [ ] Change architrecture from single MLP to heirarchical feature grids in order to improve local reconstruction details. 
- [ ] Add viewing direction for mapping to check if modelling specularities improves results.
- [ ] Adding semantic branch for keyframes.

### Paper Notes
